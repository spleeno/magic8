This is a Twilio-powered SMS application. If you text in to your Twilio number, the application will reply with a sassy, SF-hipster themed response. 

To deploy, 
- host youshould.php somewhere on the interwebs
- make a Twilio account and buy an SMS-enabled phone number
- Paste the URL of youshould.php into the SMS Request URL for that number

Now, any SMS into that URL will get an automatic reply randomly chosen from the list. 

TODO
+ only respond to questions
+ remove unfunny responses
+ add some sort of algorithm to choose an answer. For some reason it bothers people that it's random.
